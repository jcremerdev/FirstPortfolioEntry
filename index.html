      <!--About-->
      <article id="about"><h3>About Me</h3>
        <section>
        <p> While I chose to study Chemistry and work as a Lab Technologist thereafter, I sustained an interest in coding from a class I took. After a couple years, the decision was made to become a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>! The enlightening journey to become a software engineer has been full of surprises and my intrigue hasn't wavered!</p>
        <p>My other career aspiration is to work within the FBI. With this added skill, the opportunities with the Bureau are definitely widened! I hope to be applying for special agent or analyst in a few years, and joining the Bureau sometime thereafter!</p>
